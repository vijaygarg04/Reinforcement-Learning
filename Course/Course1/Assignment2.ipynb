    "## Gridworld City\n",
    "\n",
    "Gridworld City, a thriving metropolis with a booming technology industry, has recently experienced an influx of grid-loving software engineers. Unfortunately, the city's street parking system, which charges a fixed rate, is struggling to keep up with the increased demand. To address this, the city council has decided to modify the pricing scheme to better promote social welfare. In general, the city considers social welfare higher when more parking is being used, the exception being that the city prefers that at least one spot is left unoccupied (so that it is available in case someone really needs it). The city council has created a Markov decision process (MDP) to model the demand for parking with a reward function that reflects its preferences. Now the city has hired you — an expert in dynamic programming — to help determine an optimal policy."
